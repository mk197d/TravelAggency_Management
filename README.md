# TravelAggency_Management
This project aims to create a software system for travel agencies to maintain their travel packages' itinerary and passengers. The system allows managing travel packages, destinations, activities, and passengers, along with their interactions. It adheres to SOLID design principles, clean code guidelines, and includes unit tests for each class.
